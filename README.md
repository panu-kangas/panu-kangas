# Hi there! My name is Panu ☺️  

Welcome to my GitHub! 😍  

I first need to state that this place is still quite much "under construction" since I'm only just starting my GitHub journey.  
So please, bear with me 😁  

For now, only my "push_swap" -project can be found here... but that's actually an interesting one! Go check that out, more info in the repo 😎

All feed back and tips (GitHub or code related) are very much welcome! I'd like to be a real pro some day 💪

### What can you find here? ❓🤔

I'm studying in Hive Helsinki -coding school at the moment, so for now my GitHub consists mostly of my school projects.  
We do all kinds of cool thing here at Hive using the C-language and C++:  

- We rewrite basic functions and modify them to our needs.
- We create programs and algorithms that solve complex problems/tasks.
- We create and administrate Virtual Machines.
- We make games.

And the list goes on... 😁  

Evetually I will also start doing my own side projects which can then be found here 👍

### A little bit about me (the short version) 😎

👨‍🎓 Studying coding at Hive Helsinki (read more about the education here: https://www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/)  
  
🎭 Did acting for 10 years, now changing career. You might have heard my voice listening to audio books in Finnish (I've narrated over 100 of them actually... 😳)  

🔥 Super hyped and passionate about coding and computer science. It's my new thing!  

🤩 Dreaming of landing an awesome job in IT-industry. Especially interested in software development, game development, cyber security and cloud architecture.

### A little bit more about me (if you still wanna know more...) 😁

My name is Panu Kangas, and I'm a 30 year-old soon-to-be software developer. I live in Helsinki with my lovely family; wife and two kids, love them very much 🥰  

I'm a career changer. I did acting for 10 years (mostly musical theatre, audio book narratinng and cartoon dubbing) but wanted to find a more secure occupation.  
I founded coding in 2023 and fell in love immidiately; this is definitely the thing I wanna do from now on! 🔥  
Logical problem solving is really rewarding and creating new things in the digital world inspiring. 🏆

So here we are!  
I'm now studying at Hive Helsinki and want to become an expert in software development 😎

In my spare time I like to play football, enjoy movies and video games and of course hang out with my lovely kids 😍

<br/>  

### What am I working on at the moment? 🤓

💻 In school: I'm doing a project called "pipex" which is about multiple processes and how to handle them correctly.  
I'll update the files here once I'm done!

🌱 Own projects and wishes: I'm eagerly waiting for an opportunity to learn another language!  
For now I only know C and some bash, but I'd love to take a look at Python or Java.  
Just a bit busy at the moment with kids, work and school... so maybe learning these a bit later this year 🤓
