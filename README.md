### Little bit about me 😎

👨‍🎓 I'm studying coding at Hive Helsinki (read more about the education here: https://www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/)  
  
🎭 I was a musical theatre actor for 10 years, but now I'm changing career to IT. You might have heard my voice listening to audio books in Finnish, since I've narrated over 100 of them 🤓

🔥 Super hyped and passionate about coding and computer science! 

🤩 Dreaming of landing an awesome job in IT-industry.

💻 IN SCHOOL 💻

I have started my final project at Hive: Transcendence! It's a 5 developer team project that has a goal of creating a multiplayer game hosted in web browser.


🌱 OWN PROJECTS 🌱

Currently, I’m diving into full stack development through a fun Pokémon-themed database project —  go check out the Pokédex App from my repositories! ☺️
