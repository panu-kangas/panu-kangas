### Little bit about me 😎

👨‍🎓 I'm studying coding at Hive Helsinki (read more about the education here: https://www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/)  
  
🎭 I was a musical theatre actor for 10 years, but now I'm changing career to IT. You might have heard my voice listening to audio books in Finnish, since I've narrated over 100 of them 🤓

🔥 Super hyped and passionate about coding and computer science! 

🤩 Dreaming of landing an awesome job in IT-industry.

### What am I working on at the moment? 🤓

💻 IN SCHOOL 💻

I'm learning C++ at the moment, next up is a bigger project: we need to build a functioning web server with only C++!


🌱 OWN PROJECTS 🌱

I have lately been really interested about game development! So now I'm utilizing my new C++ skills to build fun games with the help of SFML-library.
