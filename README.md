### Little bit about me 😎

👨‍🎓 I'm a Hive Helsinki graduate from 2025 (read more about the education here: https://www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/)

📱 I'm currently working as an embedded software developer Trainee at Nokia. My work is mainly focused around Nokia's 5G network product
  
🎭 Before my IT career I was a musical theatre actor for 10 years. You might have heard my voice listening to audio books in Finnish; I've narrated over 100 of them 🤓

🔥 Super hyped and passionate about coding and computer science!

👾 I'm especially interested in game development, which I do as a hobby for now

### What am I working on at the moment? 🤓

💻 AT WORK 💻

My role at Nokia includes a lot of different tasks, but that are mostly focused on fixing bugs in the 5G software and developing test environments for them. I use C++ with the embedded software tasks and Python when working with tests environments.


🌱 OWN PROJECTS 🌱

Currently my goal is to build myself a portfolio website, where I can show off my own games 😎  
I did some web development with React and Typescript in Hive's final project, so now I'm putting those skills in good use.
