### Little bit about me 😎

👨‍🎓 I’m a Hive Helsinki graduate from 2025. (Read more about the education here: https://www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/)

📱 I’m currently working as an Embedded Software Trainee at Nokia. My work mainly focuses on Nokia’s 5G software.
  
🎭 Before my IT career, I was a musical theatre actor for 10 years. I’ve also had a significant career as a voice actor—I’ve narrated over 100 audiobooks and been the Finnish voice of hundreds of cartoon characters.

### What is happening at the moment? 🤓

💻 AT WORK 💻

My role at Nokia involves a variety of tasks, but most of them focus on fixing bugs in 5G software and developing test environments. I use C++ for embedded software tasks and Python when working on test environments.


🌱 OWN PROJECTS 🌱
